### The shortest path search algorithms

#### Lab 1
This lab was the fist time when we encountered with breath-first-search (`BFS`) and depth-first-search (`DFS`) algorithms. Our task was to implement these into existing code in written `java`. The code stub we got had a GUI with an instance of searching problem. 

Having GUI he had a direct visual feedback of our implementation. It was really funny to get acquainted with programming in such a way.

Besides BFS and DFS we were told to implement uninformed random search algorithm to understand how does it impact the runtime.

#### Lab 2
The second lab is an extension of the first one. New implemented algorithm were chosen specifically for this use: `A*`, `Dijkstra`, `greedy-search`. These solved the given prolem more efficiently rewarding us with a nice animation leading right to the solution.

### Semestral work
My problem to solve was to find rectangular borders of text in the given image. I chose, maybe not wisely, genetic algorithm. My results were really dependent on the exact parameters tune-up. In the end the algorithm converged to the excected solution every time, but after a long time and parameter tuning.
